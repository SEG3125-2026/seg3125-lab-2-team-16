## Key Changes

### 1. **New File: `js/products.js`**
- **Created centralized product data structure**
- All product information (name, price, image, dietary info, organic status) is now in one place
- Includes helper functions:
  - `getProductById(id)` - Get a specific product
  - `getProductsSortedByPrice()` - Get all products sorted by price
  - `filterProducts(dietaryRestrictions, organicPreference)` - Filter products based on user preferences

### 2. **Enhanced `js/main.js`**
- **Refactored filtering system** - Now uses centralized product data
- **Added `renderProducts()` function** - Dynamically renders products from data structure
- **Added `applyFilters()` function** - Unified filtering logic
- **Automatic price sorting** - Products are always displayed sorted by price (ascending)
- **Improved initialization** - Products load automatically on page load

### 3. **Improved `js/product2cart.js`**
- **Enhanced cart functionality** - Uses centralized product data instead of hardcoded values
- **Better cart sorting** - Cart items are sorted by price
- **Improved cart display** - Shows item totals (price × quantity = total)
- **Better button management** - Product buttons update correctly based on cart state
- **Made cart arrays globally accessible** - For integration with product rendering

### 4. **Updated `index.html`**
- **Removed hardcoded products** - All 10 products were hardcoded in HTML
- **Dynamic product rendering** - Products are now generated by JavaScript
- **Added products.js script** - Loads the centralized product data

### 5. **Enhanced `css/main.css`**
- **Improved cart styling** - Better spacing and visual hierarchy

- Hard to maintain and extend

### After:
- Centralized product data structure
- Dynamic product rendering
- Automatic price sorting (required feature)
